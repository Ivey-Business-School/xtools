## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# get the development version on GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Ivey-Business-School/xtools")

# this package is NOT on CRAN so you cannot install using `install.packages()`
```

If you encounter an issue while using this package, please file a minimal reproducible 
example on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ivey-Business-School/xtools/issues).

## Vignettes

## Usage

### Search X

`search_x()` allows for the user to programatically develop search query URLs for X's advanced search feature. 
It allows for filtering through keywords, hashtags, engagement thresholds, date ranges, and account interactions.

```{r search-x, eval = FALSE}
url <- search_x(
   words_exact = "full self driving",
   words_any = "optimus tesla",
   lang = "en", 
   sort = "top", 
   since = today() - months(1),
   until = today(),
   min_faves = 500,
   filter_links = "exclude", 
   filter_replies = "exclude"
)
```

## Future

Future iterations may expand to include more functions that interact with X.

## More Information

X provides examples in many programming languages, including R by using the 
package {RTwitterV2}. Please use the X API documentation for more detail around
what is expected for each endpoint and the type of data the API call will return. 
X's documentation is available here: https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api.
