  * See how many posts have been posted under a query using `get_recent_post_count()`
  * Retrieve quote posts for a given post using `get_quote_posts()`
  * Retrieve owned lists using `get_list()`
  * Obtain the accounts in a list using `get_list_member()`
  * Create a post on X using `post_to_x()`
  * Delete a post on X using `delete_from_x()`
  * Repost a post on X using `repost_to_x()`

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# get the development version on GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Ivey-Business-School/xapir")

# this package is NOT on CRAN so you cannot install using `install.packages()`
```

If you encounter an issue while using this package, please file a minimal reproducible 
example on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ivey-Business-School/xapir/issues).

## Vignettes

The README below outlines the basic package functionality. For more information 
please feel free to browse the {xapir} website at https://Ivey-Business-School.github.io/xapir/ 
which contains the following vignettes:

  * [Getting Started](https://Ivey-Business-School.github.io/xapir/articles/getting-started.html)

## Usage

### Authenticate
First, initialize your X bearer token and client ID for future use. 

```{r init, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)

# Once the renviron file open, paste your bearer token as <X_BEARER_TOKEN = ""> 
# and your client ID as <X_CLIENT_ID = "">, then restart R
edit_r_environ()
```

From here, you can load the packages required. 

```{r auth, eval = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
library(xapir)
```

After supplying your token, client ID, and loading the package, you can begin running functions that call the X APIs.

### Get Timeline

`get_timeline()` allows for the timeline of an account to be extracted through the X API. The following 
example uses the function to extract all posts from Tesla between January 1, 2025 to January 31, 2025. 

```{r get-timeline, eval = FALSE}
response <- get_timeline(
  username = "Tesla",
  max_results = 100,
  max_posts = 500,
  start_time = iso_8601("2025-01-01"), 
  end_time = iso_8601("2025-01-31"),
)
```

### Search X

`search_x()` allows for the user to programatically develop search query URLs for X's advanced search feature. 
It allows for filtering through keywords, hashtags, engagement thresholds, date ranges, and account interactions.

```{r search-x, eval = FALSE}
url <- search_x(
   words_exact = "full self driving",
   words_any = "optimus tesla",
   lang = "en", 
   sort = "top", 
   since = today() - months(1),
   until = today(),
   min_faves = 500,
   filter_links = "exclude", 
   filter_replies = "exclude"
)
```

### Get Recent Post

`get_recent_post()` allows for the user to search for posts using a query within the last 7 days. The 
following example uses the function to extract posts related to weddings and are not retweets nor replies.

``` {r get-recent-post, eval = FALSE} 
response <- get_recent_post(
  query = "weddings -is:retweet -is:reply"
)
```

### Get Recent Post Count

`get_recent_post_count()` allows for the user to see how many posts were posted within the last 7 days. The following
example uses the function to count the number of posts related to weddings and are not retweets nor replies.

``` {r get-recent-post-count, eval = FALSE} 
post_count <- get_recent_post_count(
  query = "weddings -is:retweet -is:reply"
)
```

### Get Quote Posts

`get_quote_posts()` allows for the user to retrieve information about posts that quote a specific post. The following
example uses the function to retrieve up to 100 posts that quote post the first post on X.

``` {r get-quote-posts, eval = FALSE} 
response <- get_quote_posts(
  post_id = "20",
  max_results = 100
)
```

### Get List

`get_list()` allows for the user to extract the IDs of their owned lists. The following example uses 
the function to retrieve the lists owned by Tesla.

``` {r get-list, eval = FALSE} 
list_IDs <- get_list(
  username = "Tesla"
)
```

### Get List Member

`get_list_member()` allows for the user to extract the IDs and usernames of the members of a list. The following 
example uses the function to retrieve the members of Tesla's "ev-news" list.

``` {r get-list-member, eval = FALSE} 
response <- get_list_member(
  list_id = "45924881"
)
```

### Post to X

`post_to_x()` allows the user to create a post on their X account. The following example uses the function to 
post the phrase "Hello world!" on X.

``` {r post-to-x, eval = FALSE} 
post_to_x(
  text = "Hello world!"
)
```

### Delete From X

`delete_from_x()` allows the user to delete a specific post on their X account using its post ID. The following 
example uses the function to delete a post with a post ID value of "20".

``` {r delete_from_x, eval = FALSE} 
delete_from_x(
  post_id = "20"
)
```

### Repost To X

`repost_to_x()` allows the user to repost a specific post on their X account using its post ID. The following 
example uses the function to repost the first ever post on X.

``` {r repost-from-x, eval = FALSE} 
repost_to_x(
  post_id = "20"
)
```

### Follow User

`follow_user()` allows the user to follow, or request to follow for protected users, the target user. The following
example uses the function to follow Elon Musk from the perspective of Tesla.

``` {r follow-user, eval = FALSE} 
follow_user(
  source_username = "Tesla",
  target_username = "elonmusk"
)
```

### Unfollow User

`unfollow_user()` allows the user to unfollow the target user. The following example uses the function 
to unfollow Elon Musk from the perspective of Tesla.

``` {r unfollow-user, eval = FALSE} 
unfollow_user(
  source_username = "Tesla",
  target_username = "elonmusk"
)
```

### Extract Posts

`extract_post()` uses the results from the API call and cleans the data to return a tibble of all tweets. 

```{r extract-post, eval = FALSE}
posts <- extract_post(
  timeline = response
)
```

### Extract Post Media

`extract_post_media()` uses the results from the API call and cleans the data to return a tibble of all
media contained in tweets. 

```{r extract-post-media, eval = FALSE}
post_media <- extract_post_media(
  timeline = response
)
```

### Extract Users

`extract_user()` uses the results from the API call and cleans the data to return a tibble of all users. 
This includes accounts whose tweets were retweeted by the targeted account. 

```{r extract-user, eval = FALSE}
users <-  extract_user(
  timeline = response
)
```

## Future

This package only contains functions that use a subset of the X API endpoints.
Future iterations may expand upon this to include more.

## More Information

X provides examples in many programming languages, including R by using the 
package {RTwitterV2}. Please use the X API documentation for more detail around
what is expected for each endpoint and the type of data the API call will return. 
X's documentation is available here: https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api.
