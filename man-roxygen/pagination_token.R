#' @param pagination_token A string used to navigate backward through result
#'   pages. The X API provides this token when more results are available.
#'   Typically, you wonâ€™t need to set this manually as the function handles it,
#'   but you can supply a pagination_token from a previous response to continue
#'   retrieving results beyond the last page, if desired.
